    "I actually spent all day on this before realizing it could be solved without a computer at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stating the obvious:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Because our initial position is $\\left(0, 0\\right)$ and the target's minimum coordinate along the $x$-axis is greater than zero, our initial velocity along the $x$-axis must be positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "* That means that our velocity along the $x$-axis across the probe's entire trajectory is either positive or zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "* And that means that the probe's _position_ vector can only have a finite number of values for its $x$-coordinate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also obvious, but it took me hours of math before fully grokking its implications:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Observation 1**: The probe's motion along the $y$-axis is independent from its motion along the $x$-axis. We're looking for the maximum height, so we only need to consider velocity and position along the $y$-axis — since the problem has a solution, we know that there's some value for the initial velocity's $x$-component that lands the probe in the target area, _but we don't need to find it_.\n",
    "\n",
    "From now on, talking about velocity and position, let's assume we're working in a single dimension along the $y$-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The target ranges over the closed interval $\\left[T_{min}, T_{max}\\right]$, where $T_{max} < 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Observation 2** is about the important points in the trajectory of the probe. Given initial velocity $v_0$, then the probe's position is zero at times $t = 0$ and $t = 2v_0 + 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probe's velocity changes by -1 each unit of time. So $v\\left(t\\right) = v_0 - t$. \n",
    "\n",
    "It takes $v_0$ units of time for the probe's velocity to change from $v_0$ to 0. The probe's velocity is zero for one unit of time, and then another $v_0$ units for its velocity to change from zero to $-v_0$. Total time is $2v_0 + 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can add all of those velocity vectors to see that each vector pointing in the positive direction has a corresponding vector in the negative direction. They all cancel out so the net velocity is zero, and the net displacement is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Observation 3**: At time $2v_0 + 1$, the probe's velocity is $-v_0 - 1$. That means its _position_ at time $2v_0 + 2 = -v_0 - 1$ (because its position at $t = 2v_0 + 1$ is zero).\n",
    "\n",
    "This puts an upper bound on our initial velocity, which is what we want in order to find the upper bound on the probe's height. Notice that if $v_0 > -T_{min} + 1$, then we have the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* At time $2v_0 + 1$, we have $y = 0 > T_{max}$ (from above).\n",
    "\n",
    "* At time $2v_0 + 2$, we have $y = -v_0 - 1$. But if $v_0 > -T_{min} + 1$ then we have: $$v_0 - 1 > -T_{min}$$ and $$-v_0 + 1 < T_{min}$$ (multiplying by -1 switches the signs) and finally $$-v_0 - 1 < -v_0 + 1 < T_{min}$$ is outside the target bounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The upshot of this whole thing is that $v_{max} = -T_{min} + 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Observation 4**: The maximum height of the probe with initial velocity $v_0$ (where $v_0 > 0$) is the $v_0$-th triangular number.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Observation 2, we noticed that at time $t = v_0$, the velocity of the probe had take all (and only) values that are natural numbers less than or equal to $v_0$. Each velocity lasted for a duration of one time unit, so the position vector is simply the sum of those velocity vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "So without writing a line of Python code (even though I _did_ write a lot of Python code), given the example problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "target area: x=20..30, y=-10..-5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We see that $$\\begin{aligned} y_{min} &= -10 \\\\ ⇒ v_{y_{max}} &= -(-10 + 1) = 9 \\\\ ⇒ y_{max} &= \\frac{9 \\cdot 10}{2} = 45 \\end{aligned}$$."
